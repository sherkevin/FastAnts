-------
SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM Reply in English (united states).
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in English (united states).
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: English (united states)
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-12-07
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Reply in English (united states).
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.

USER #!/bin/sh
USER 
USER # An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
USER #
USER # This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
USER # push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
USER # tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
USER # receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
USER # updateInstead.
USER #
USER # By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
USER # of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
USER # checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
USER # the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
USER # of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
USER # behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
USER # as a starting point for convenient modification.
USER #
USER # The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
USER # branch is going to be updated:
USER commit=$1
USER 
USER # It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
USER # so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
USER die () {
USER 	echo >&2 "$*"

USER }
USER 
USER # Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
USER # index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
USER # branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
USER #
USER # For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
USER # in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
USER # with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
USER # essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
USER # branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
USER # not interfere with the difference between the branches.
USER 
USER # The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
USER # for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
USER # the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
USER #
USER # Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,

USER <<\DOC_END
USER 
USER This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
USER published from being rewound.
USER 
USER The workflow assumed here is:
USER 
USER  * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
USER    merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).
USER 
USER  * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
USER    it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
USER    earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
USER    the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
USER    it makes it easier to keep your history simple.
USER 
USER  * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
USER    branches, merge them into "next" branch.
USER 
USER The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
USER to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
USER $GIT_DIR/config mechanism.
USER 
USER With this workflow, you would want to know:
USER 
USER (1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
USER     topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
USER     clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
USER     merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
USER     affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
USER     not want to rewind it.
USER 
USER (2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
USER     Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
USER     build on top of it -- other people may already want to
USER     change things related to the topic as patches against your
USER     "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
USER     fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
USER     tip of "master".
USER 
USER Let's look at this example:
USER 
USER 		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
USER 		  /       /           /           /
USER 		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
USER 		/   /               /           /
USER 	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
USER 	      /   /   /             \         /
USER 	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
USER 	    /   /   /   /             \     /
USER     ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"
USER 
USER 
USER A, B and C are topic branches.
USER 
USER  * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".
USER 
USER  * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
USER    and is ready to be deleted.
USER 
USER  * C has not merged to "next" at all.
USER 
USER We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
USER B to be deleted.
USER 
USER To compute (1):
USER 
USER 	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
USER 	git rev-list ^master        next
USER 
USER 	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.
USER 
USER To compute (2):
USER 
USER 	git rev-list master..topic
USER 
USER 	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

USER 【system prompt】：你是一个在自动化工作流中运行的智能 Agent。
USER 你的工作分为两个阶段：【执行】和【汇报】。
USER 
USER ### 1. 执行阶段 (Execution Phase)
USER 根据任务要求，完成具体工作，注意你的任何工作产出的文档、代码等交付物都**必须**要放在collab文件夹下。
USER 
USER 你可以在工作区下除collab的任何地方建立个人文件夹，可以存储你的思考，关键信息等和交付物无关的文件。
USER 
USER ### 2. 汇报阶段 (Reporting Phase)
USER 
USER **必须**在所有的工作完毕后，另起一段，严格按照以下 JSON 格式汇报你的决策状态。
USER 系统会根据这个 JSON 来决定下一步流程。
USER ```json
USER {
USER   "content": "简要总结你做了什么，如：我新建了一个collab/index.html文件，用于绘制PPT",
USER   "decisions": {
USER     // 根据当前状态的要求填写具体的字段
USER   }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER 重要原则：
USER - 永远将交付物放在collab文件夹下。
USER - 永远保持JSON格式的汇报在回复的最后部分。
USER 【role】：你是甲方（需求方）。
USER 【任务目标】：制作一份关于胡辣汤的宣传PPT
USER 【instruction】：
USER 
USER 请提出你的需求，并创建需求文档：
USER - 包括：PPT主题、页面数量、风格要求、重点内容、特殊要求
USER 
USER 【decisions字段说明】：
USER {
USER   "decisions": {
USER     "request_complete": true // [boolean]：true: 需求描述已完成，准备好与乙方讨论；false: 还需要继续补充需求
USER   }
USER }

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English (united states).
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM Reply in English (united states).
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in English (united states).
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: English (united states)
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-12-07
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Reply in English (united states).
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

USER Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Import the math package.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
ASSISTANT 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT mathweb/flask/app.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT from flask import Flask

ASSISTANT import math
ASSISTANT from flask import Flask
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```

USER Refactor hello() into its own file.
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT hello.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT def hello():
ASSISTANT     "print a greeting"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     print("hello")
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT main.py
ASSISTANT ```python

USER 
USER This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
USER published from being rewound.
USER 
USER The workflow assumed here is:
USER 
USER  * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
USER    merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).
USER 
USER  * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
USER    it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
USER    earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
USER    the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
USER    it makes it easier to keep your history simple.
USER 
USER  * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
USER    branches, merge them into "next" branch.
USER 
USER The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
USER to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
USER $GIT_DIR/config mechanism.
USER 
USER With this workflow, you would want to know:
USER 
USER (1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
USER     topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
USER     clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
USER     merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
USER     affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
USER     not want to rewind it.
USER 
USER (2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
USER     Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
USER     build on top of it -- other people may already want to
USER     change things related to the topic as patches against your
USER     "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
USER     fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
USER     tip of "master".
USER 
USER Let's look at this example:
USER 
USER 		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
USER 		  /       /           /           /
USER 		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
USER 		/   /               /           /
USER 	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
USER 	      /   /   /             \         /
USER 	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
USER 	    /   /   /   /             \     /
USER     ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"
USER 
USER 
USER A, B and C are topic branches.
USER 
USER  * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".
USER 
USER  * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
USER    and is ready to be deleted.
USER 
USER  * C has not merged to "next" at all.
USER 
USER We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
USER B to be deleted.
USER 
USER To compute (1):
USER 
USER 	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
USER 	git rev-list ^master        next
USER 
USER 	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.
USER 
USER To compute (2):
USER 
USER 	git rev-list master..topic
USER 
USER 	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

USER 
USER # An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
USER #
USER # This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
USER # push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
USER # tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
USER # receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
USER # updateInstead.
USER #
USER # By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
USER # of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
USER # checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
USER # the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
USER # of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
USER # behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
USER # as a starting point for convenient modification.
USER #
USER # The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
USER # branch is going to be updated:
USER commit=$1
USER 
USER # It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
USER # so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
USER die () {
USER 	echo >&2 "$*"
USER 	exit 1
USER }
USER 
USER # Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
USER # index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
USER # branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
USER #
USER # For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
USER # in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
USER # with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
USER # essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
USER # branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
USER # not interfere with the difference between the branches.
USER 
USER # The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
USER # for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
USER # the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.

USER # Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,

USER 【system prompt】：你是一个在自动化工作流中运行的智能 Agent。
USER 你的工作分为两个阶段：【执行】和【汇报】。
USER 
USER ### 1. 执行阶段 (Execution Phase)
USER 根据任务要求，完成具体工作，注意你的任何工作产出的文档、代码等交付物都**必须**要放在collab文件夹下。
USER 
USER 你可以在工作区下除collab的任何地方建立个人文件夹，可以存储你的思考，关键信息等和交付物无关的文件。
USER 
USER ### 2. 汇报阶段 (Reporting Phase)
USER 
USER **必须**在所有的工作完毕后，另起一段，严格按照以下 JSON 格式汇报你的决策状态。
USER 系统会根据这个 JSON 来决定下一步流程。
USER ```json
USER {
USER   "content": "简要总结你做了什么，如：我新建了一个collab/index.html文件，用于绘制PPT",
USER   "decisions": {
USER     // 根据当前状态的要求填写具体的字段
USER   }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER 重要原则：
USER - 永远将交付物放在collab文件夹下。
USER - 永远保持JSON格式的汇报在回复的最后部分。
USER 【role】：你是乙方（开发者/设计师）。
USER 【任务目标】：与甲方讨论PPT设计方案，确认需求细节。
USER 【instruction】：
USER 甲方说：我创建了一份详细的胡辣汤宣传PPT需求文档，包含了PPT主题、页面数量、风格要求、重点内容和特殊要求等完整信息，为后续的PPT制作提供了清晰的指导方向。
USER 请执行以下操作：
USER 1. **分析需求**：确认主题、风格、页数等关键信息。
USER 2. **提出方案**：简述你的设计思路（结构、配色、交互）。
USER 3. **确认细节**：询问不明确的地方。
USER 【decisions字段说明】：
USER {
USER   "decisions": {
USER     "design_confirmed": false,  // [必填] boolean
USER                                 // true: 双方已达成一致，方案已确认。
USER                                 // false: 还需要继续讨论。
USER     "ready_to_build": false     // [必填] boolean
USER                                 // true: 已具备开发所需的所有信息，可以开始编码。
USER                                 // false: 信息不足，暂不能开始。
USER   }
USER }

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English (united states).
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: English (united states)
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-12-07
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Reply in English (united states).
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.

USER client/.git/hooks/push-to-checkout.sample
USER ```
USER #!/bin/sh
USER 
USER # An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
USER #
USER # This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
USER # push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
USER # tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
USER # receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
USER # updateInstead.
USER #
USER # By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
USER # of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
USER # checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
USER # the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
USER # of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
USER # behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
USER # as a starting point for convenient modification.
USER #
USER # The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
USER # branch is going to be updated:
USER commit=$1
USER 
USER # It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
USER # so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
USER die () {
USER 	echo >&2 "$*"
USER 	exit 1
USER }
USER 
USER # Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
USER # index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
USER # branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
USER #
USER # For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
USER # in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
USER # with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
USER # essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
USER # branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
USER # not interfere with the difference between the branches.
USER 
USER # The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
USER # for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
USER # the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
USER #
USER # Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
USER # not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
USER # the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
USER # by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

USER <<\DOC_END
USER 
USER This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
USER published from being rewound.
USER 
USER The workflow assumed here is:
USER 
USER  * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
USER    merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).
USER 
USER  * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
USER    it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
USER    earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
USER    the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
USER    it makes it easier to keep your history simple.
USER 
USER  * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
USER    branches, merge them into "next" branch.
USER 
USER The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
USER to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
USER $GIT_DIR/config mechanism.
USER 
USER With this workflow, you would want to know:
USER 
USER (1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
USER     topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
USER     clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
USER     merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
USER     affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
USER     not want to rewind it.
USER 
USER (2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
USER     Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
USER     build on top of it -- other people may already want to
USER     change things related to the topic as patches against your
USER     "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
USER     fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
USER     tip of "master".
USER 
USER Let's look at this example:
USER 
USER 		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
USER 		  /       /           /           /
USER 		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
USER 		/   /               /           /
USER 	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
USER 	      /   /   /             \         /
USER 	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
USER 	    /   /   /   /             \     /
USER     ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"
USER 
USER 
USER A, B and C are topic branches.
USER 
USER  * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".
USER 
USER  * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
USER    and is ready to be deleted.
USER 
USER  * C has not merged to "next" at all.
USER 
USER We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
USER B to be deleted.
USER 
USER To compute (1):
USER 
USER 	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
USER 	git rev-list ^master        next
USER 
USER 	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.
USER 
USER To compute (2):
USER 
USER 	git rev-list master..topic
USER 
USER 	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

USER 【system prompt】：你是一个在自动化工作流中运行的智能 Agent。
USER 你的工作分为两个阶段：【执行】和【汇报】。
USER 
USER ### 1. 执行阶段 (Execution Phase)
USER 根据任务要求，完成具体工作，注意你的任何工作产出的文档、代码等交付物都**必须**要放在collab文件夹下。
USER 
USER 你可以在工作区下除collab的任何地方建立个人文件夹，可以存储你的思考，关键信息等和交付物无关的文件。
USER 
USER ### 2. 汇报阶段 (Reporting Phase)
USER 
USER **必须**在所有的工作完毕后，另起一段，严格按照以下 JSON 格式汇报你的决策状态。
USER 系统会根据这个 JSON 来决定下一步流程。
USER ```json
USER {
USER   "content": "简要总结你做了什么，如：我新建了一个collab/index.html文件，用于绘制PPT",
USER   "decisions": {
USER     // 根据当前状态的要求填写具体的字段
USER   }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER 重要原则：
USER - 永远将交付物放在collab文件夹下。
USER - 永远保持JSON格式的汇报在回复的最后部分。
USER 【role】：你是甲方。
USER 【任务目标】：回复乙方问题，确认设计方案。
USER 【instruction】：
USER 乙方说：我分析了胡辣汤PPT需求文档，提出了完整的设计方案包括结构、配色和交互设计，并列出了13个需要确认的细节问题，涵盖品牌信息、产品细节、视觉素材和技术要求等方面。
USER 
USER 请执行以下操作：
USER 1. 回答乙方的问题。
USER 2. 确认或调整方案。
USER 3. 如果乙方的方案基本符合要求，请明确回复“方案通过，请开始制作”，以推进项目进度。
USER 4. 如果需要更新需求，需要更新需求文档并在返回的content中明确说明
USER 
USER 【decisions字段说明】：
USER {
USER   "decisions": {
USER       "approve_design": true  // [必填] boolean
USER                               // true: 同意当前设计方案，允许乙方开始制作。
USER                               // false: 不同意，需要继续修改或讨论。
USER   }
USER }

USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English (united states).
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM Reply in English (united states).
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in English (united states).
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: English (united states)
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-12-07
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Reply in English (united states).
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

USER <<\DOC_END
USER 
USER This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
USER published from being rewound.
USER 
USER The workflow assumed here is:
USER 
USER  * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
USER    merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).
USER 
USER  * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
USER    it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
USER    earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
USER    the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
USER    it makes it easier to keep your history simple.
USER 
USER  * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
USER    branches, merge them into "next" branch.
USER 
USER The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
USER to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
USER $GIT_DIR/config mechanism.
USER 
USER With this workflow, you would want to know:
USER 
USER (1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
USER     topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
USER     clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
USER     merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
USER     affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
USER     not want to rewind it.
USER 
USER (2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
USER     Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
USER     build on top of it -- other people may already want to
USER     change things related to the topic as patches against your
USER     "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
USER     fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
USER     tip of "master".
USER 
USER Let's look at this example:
USER 
USER 		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
USER 		  /       /           /           /
USER 		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
USER 		/   /               /           /
USER 	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
USER 	      /   /   /             \         /
USER 	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
USER 	    /   /   /   /             \     /
USER     ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"
USER 
USER 
USER A, B and C are topic branches.
USER 
USER  * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".
USER 
USER  * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
USER    and is ready to be deleted.
USER 
USER  * C has not merged to "next" at all.
USER 
USER We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
USER B to be deleted.
USER 
USER To compute (1):
USER 
USER 	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
USER 	git rev-list ^master        next
USER 
USER 	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.
USER 
USER To compute (2):
USER 
USER 	git rev-list master..topic
USER 
USER 	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

USER #!/bin/sh
USER 
USER # An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
USER #
USER # This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
USER # push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
USER # tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
USER # receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
USER # updateInstead.
USER #
USER # By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
USER # of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
USER # checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
USER # the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
USER # of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
USER # behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
USER # as a starting point for convenient modification.
USER #
USER # The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
USER # branch is going to be updated:
USER commit=$1
USER 
USER # It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
USER # so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
USER die () {
USER 	echo >&2 "$*"
USER 	exit 1
USER }
USER 
USER # Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
USER # index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
USER # branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
USER #
USER # For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
USER # in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
USER # with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
USER # essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
USER # branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
USER # not interfere with the difference between the branches.
USER 
USER # The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
USER # for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
USER # the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
USER #
USER # Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
USER # not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English (united states).
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM Reply in English (united states).
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in English (united states).
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: English (united states)
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-12-07
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Reply in English (united states).
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.

SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.

USER Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Import the math package.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
ASSISTANT 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT mathweb/flask/app.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT from flask import Flask
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT import math
ASSISTANT from flask import Flask
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT mathweb/flask/app.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT def factorial(n):
ASSISTANT     "compute factorial"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     if n == 0:
ASSISTANT         return 1
ASSISTANT     else:
ASSISTANT         return n * factorial(n-1)
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT mathweb/flask/app.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT     return str(factorial(n))
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT     return str(math.factorial(n))
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
-------
USER Refactor hello() into its own file.
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT hello.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT def hello():
ASSISTANT     "print a greeting"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     print("hello")
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT main.py
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT <<<<<<< SEARCH
ASSISTANT def hello():
ASSISTANT     "print a greeting"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     print("hello")
ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT from hello import hello
ASSISTANT >>>>>>> REPLACE
ASSISTANT ```

USER 【system prompt】：你是一个在自动化工作流中运行的智能 Agent。
USER 你的工作分为两个阶段：【执行】和【汇报】。
USER 
USER ### 1. 执行阶段 (Execution Phase)
USER 根据任务要求，完成具体工作，注意你的任何工作产出的文档、代码等交付物都**必须**要放在collab文件夹下。
USER 
USER 你可以在工作区下除collab的任何地方建立个人文件夹，可以存储你的思考，关键信息等和交付物无关的文件。
USER 
USER ### 2. 汇报阶段 (Reporting Phase)
USER 
USER **必须**在所有的工作完毕后，另起一段，严格按照以下 JSON 格式汇报你的决策状态。
USER 系统会根据这个 JSON 来决定下一步流程。
USER ```json
USER {
USER   "content": "简要总结你做了什么，如：我新建了一个collab/index.html文件，用于绘制PPT",
USER   "decisions": {

USER client/.git/hooks/push-to-checkout.sample
USER ```
USER #!/bin/sh
USER 
USER # An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
USER #
USER # This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
USER # push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
USER # tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
USER # receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
USER # updateInstead.
USER #
USER # By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
USER # of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
USER # checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
USER # the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
USER # of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
USER # behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
USER # as a starting point for convenient modification.
USER #
USER # The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
USER # branch is going to be updated:
USER commit=$1
USER 
USER # It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
USER # so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
USER die () {
USER 	echo >&2 "$*"
USER 	exit 1
USER }
USER 
USER # Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
USER # index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
USER # branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
USER #
USER # For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
USER # in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
USER # with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
USER # essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
USER # branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
USER # not interfere with the difference between the branches.
USER 
USER # The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
USER # for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
USER # the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
USER #
USER # Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
USER # not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
USER # the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
USER # by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

USER <<\DOC_END
USER 
USER This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
USER published from being rewound.
USER 
USER The workflow assumed here is:
USER 
USER  * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
USER    merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).
USER 
USER  * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
USER    it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
USER    earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
USER    the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
USER    it makes it easier to keep your history simple.
USER 
USER  * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
USER    branches, merge them into "next" branch.
USER 
USER The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
USER to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
USER $GIT_DIR/config mechanism.
USER 
USER With this workflow, you would want to know:
USER 
USER (1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
USER     topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
USER     clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
USER     merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
USER     affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
USER     not want to rewind it.
USER 
USER (2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
USER     Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
USER     build on top of it -- other people may already want to
USER     change things related to the topic as patches against your
USER     "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
USER     fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
USER     tip of "master".
USER 
USER Let's look at this example:
USER 
USER 		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
USER 		  /       /           /           /
USER 		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
USER 		/   /               /           /
USER 	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
USER 	      /   /   /             \         /
USER 	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
USER 	    /   /   /   /             \     /
USER     ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"
USER 
USER 
USER A, B and C are topic branches.
USER 
USER  * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".
USER 
USER  * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
USER    and is ready to be deleted.
USER 
USER  * C has not merged to "next" at all.
USER 
USER We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
USER B to be deleted.
USER 
USER To compute (1):
USER 
USER 	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
USER 	git rev-list ^master        next
USER 
USER 	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.
USER 
USER To compute (2):
USER 
USER 	git rev-list master..topic
USER 
USER 	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

USER 【system prompt】：你是一个在自动化工作流中运行的智能 Agent。
USER 你的工作分为两个阶段：【执行】和【汇报】。
USER 
USER ### 1. 执行阶段 (Execution Phase)
USER 根据任务要求，完成具体工作，注意你的任何工作产出的文档、代码等交付物都**必须**要放在collab文件夹下。
USER 
USER 你可以在工作区下除collab的任何地方建立个人文件夹，可以存储你的思考，关键信息等和交付物无关的文件。
USER 
USER ### 2. 汇报阶段 (Reporting Phase)
USER 
USER **必须**在所有的工作完毕后，另起一段，严格按照以下 JSON 格式汇报你的决策状态。
USER 系统会根据这个 JSON 来决定下一步流程。
USER ```json
USER {
USER   "content": "简要总结你做了什么，如：我新建了一个collab/index.html文件，用于绘制PPT",
USER   "decisions": {
USER     // 根据当前状态的要求填写具体的字段
USER   }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER 重要原则：
USER - 永远将交付物放在collab文件夹下。
USER - 永远保持JSON格式的汇报在回复的最后部分。
USER 【role】：你是甲方。
USER 【任务目标】：评审PPT效果并给出反馈。
USER 【instruction】：
USER 乙方说：我创建了一个完整的HTML PPT演示文稿，包含12页胡辣汤品牌推广内容，采用传统中国风设计风格，支持响应式布局、键盘导航、触摸操作等现代交互功能，并提供了详细的README说明文档。
USER 请打开html文件查看PPT效果，然后给出反馈：
USER 1. 检查功能是否正常（翻页、动画）。
USER 2. 检查内容是否符合需求。
USER 3. 给出具体的修改建议或批准通过。
USER 【decisions字段说明】：
USER {
USER   "decisions": {
USER     "satisfaction_score": 7,   // [必填] number (1-10)
USER                                // 满意度评分。如果 >= 8，流程可能结束。
USER     "needs_revision": true,    // [必填] boolean
USER                                // true: 需要乙方修改。
USER                                // false: 不需要修改。
USER     "approved": false          // [必填] boolean
USER                                // true: 最终通过，项目结束。
USER                                // false: 尚未通过。

USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ```
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English (united states).
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

-------
SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM Reply in English (united states).
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in English (united states).
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: Linux-5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2-x86_64-with-glibc2.35
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/bash
SYSTEM - Language: English (united states)
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-12-07
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Reply in English (united states).
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

USER Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Import the math package.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
ASSISTANT 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
ASSISTANT

USER Refactor hello() into its own file.
-------
ASSISTANT To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
ASSISTANT 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT hello.py
ASSISTANT ````python

ASSISTANT =======
ASSISTANT def hello():
ASSISTANT     "print a greeting"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     print("hello")

USER 
USER This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
USER published from being rewound.
USER 
USER The workflow assumed here is:
USER 
USER  * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
USER    merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).
USER 
USER  * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
USER    it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
USER    earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
USER    the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
USER    it makes it easier to keep your history simple.
USER 
USER  * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
USER    branches, merge them into "next" branch.
USER 
USER The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
USER to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
USER $GIT_DIR/config mechanism.
USER 
USER With this workflow, you would want to know:
USER 
USER (1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
USER     topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
USER     clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
USER     merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
USER     affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
USER     not want to rewind it.
USER 
USER (2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
USER     Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
USER     build on top of it -- other people may already want to
USER     change things related to the topic as patches against your
USER     "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
USER     fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
USER     tip of "master".
USER 
USER Let's look at this example:
USER 
USER 		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
USER 		  /       /           /           /
USER 		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
USER 		/   /               /           /
USER 	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
USER 	      /   /   /             \         /
USER 	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
USER 	    /   /   /   /             \     /
USER     ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"
USER 
USER 
USER A, B and C are topic branches.
USER 
USER  * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".
USER 
USER  * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
USER    and is ready to be deleted.
USER 
USER  * C has not merged to "next" at all.
USER 
USER We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
USER B to be deleted.
USER 
USER To compute (1):
USER 
USER 	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
USER 	git rev-list ^master        next
USER 
USER 	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.
USER 
USER To compute (2):
USER 
USER 	git rev-list master..topic
USER 
USER 	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

USER 
USER # An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
USER #
USER # This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
USER # push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
USER # tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
USER # receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
USER # updateInstead.
USER #
USER # By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
USER # of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
USER # checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
USER # the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
USER # of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
USER # behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
USER # as a starting point for convenient modification.
USER #
USER # The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
USER # branch is going to be updated:
USER commit=$1
USER 
USER # It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
USER # so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
USER die () {
USER 	echo >&2 "$*"
USER 	exit 1
USER }
USER 
USER # Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
USER # index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
USER # branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
USER #
USER # For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
USER # in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
USER # with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
USER # essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
USER # branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
USER # not interfere with the difference between the branches.
USER 
USER # The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
USER # for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
USER # the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
USER #
USER # Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
USER # not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on

USER # An example hook script to prepare the commit log message.
USER # Called by "git commit" with the name of the file that has the
USER # commit message, followed by the description of the commit
USER # message's source.  The hook's purpose is to edit the commit
USER # message file.  If the hook fails with a non-zero status,

USER # To enable this hook, rename this file to "prepare-commit-msg".

USER # into the message, just before the "git status" output.  It is
USER # commented because it doesn't cope with --amend or with squashed
USER # commits.

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.

USER 【system prompt】：你是一个在自动化工作流中运行的智能 Agent。
USER 你的工作分为两个阶段：【执行】和【汇报】。
USER 
USER ### 1. 执行阶段 (Execution Phase)
USER 根据任务要求，完成具体工作，注意你的任何工作产出的文档、代码等交付物都**必须**要放在collab文件夹下。
USER 
USER 你可以在工作区下除collab的任何地方建立个人文件夹，可以存储你的思考，关键信息等和交付物无关的文件。
USER 
USER ### 2. 汇报阶段 (Reporting Phase)
USER 
USER **必须**在所有的工作完毕后，另起一段，严格按照以下 JSON 格式汇报你的决策状态。
USER 系统会根据这个 JSON 来决定下一步流程。
USER ```json
USER {
USER   "content": "简要总结你做了什么，如：我新建了一个collab/index.html文件，用于绘制PPT",
USER   "decisions": {
USER     // 根据当前状态的要求填写具体的字段
USER   }
USER }
USER ```
USER 
USER 重要原则：
USER - 永远将交付物放在collab文件夹下。
USER - 永远保持JSON格式的汇报在回复的最后部分。
USER 【role】：你是乙方。
USER 【任务目标】：根据反馈修改PPT。
USER 【instruction】：
USER 甲方说：我对乙方创建的HTML PPT演示文稿进行了全面评审，检查了功能、内容和设计，发现整体质量较高但还有一些细节需要优化。我创建了详细的评审反馈文档，包含了具体的修改建议，涵盖功能优化、内容完善、交互增强和技术优化等方面。
USER 请根据反馈修改html文件：
USER 1. 逐条解决甲方提出的问题。
USER 2. 优化代码和视觉效果。
USER 3. 修改完成后，请简要汇报修改内容。
USER 【decisions字段说明】：
USER {
USER   "decisions": {
USER     "revision_complete": true, // [必填] boolean
USER                                // true: 修改工作已全部完成。
USER                                // false: 还在修改中。
USER     "quality_improved": 9      // [可选] number (1-10)
USER                                // 修改后的质量评分。
USER   }
USER }

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER IMPORTANT: Use *quadruple* backticks ```` as fences, not triple backticks!
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER Reply in English (united states).
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.
